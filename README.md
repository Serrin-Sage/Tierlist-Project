# TierList Creator
## Functionality:
    
    A user can sign in if they exist in the database. If not they can sign up which will add them to the database.

    After sign in the user can view default characters and add them to the tier of their choosing. Characters can be removed from a tier and placed in new tiers. Characters can only exist in one tier. The user can add new characters if they provide a name, thumbnail image, display image, strength and weakness for the character. 

    Tier list can be saved globally and viewed by each user in the Global Tiers page.


new dependencies used:
- react-toastify (creates user notifications)


Future plans (if I continue with this project):
    - Have search functionality for the user (manual input is tedious)
    - Add and give functionality to Agree and Disagree buttons
    - Delete users
    - Delete Characters
    - Remove characters from tierlist with click
